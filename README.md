# Supervised-Learning-Classification_Project_INNHotels

* The project leverages supervised learning, where the model is trained on labeled data (e.g., past cancellations) to learn the relationship between input features and the target variable (cancellation or no cancellation).
* The project uses a dataset of 36,275 booking records with 19 features, including guest information, booking details, and special requests.
* The core of the project involves using classification algorithms to predict the probability of a booking being canceled. These algorithms learn from the training data to classify new bookings into "canceled" or "not canceled" categories.
